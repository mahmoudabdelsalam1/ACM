Ali Baba was a son of a merchant. After his father's death, Ali Baba married a poor woman and settled into the trade of a woodcutter. One day, Ali Baba
was at work collecting and cutting firewood in the forest, when he happened to overhear a group of 40 thieves visiting their treasure store. The treasure was in a cave. When Ali Baba
went to the cave he found out that he had to solve a puzzle.


The puzzle was very easy. Ali Baba was given 4numbers. His task was to check wheather he could get the fourth number by using the arithmetic operators (+,−,×)
between the other three numbers. Knowing that an operator can be used only once.
                                           a□b□c=d
Sadly, Ali Baba was really bad at math and he aksed you to help him solve this puzzle.

Input
The first line of input contains 4 integers a,b,c and d (−109≤a,b,c≤109),(−1018≤d≤1018).

Output
Print "YES"(quotes for clarity) if you found the fourth number using the first three, otherwise print "NO"(quotes for clarity).
You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Examples
Input
3 4 5 23
Output
YES
Input
9 5 3 7
Output
YES
Input
1 2 3 1
